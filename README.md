### Hi! I'm Ben and I'm a Junior Front-End Developer ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ During the day I follow courses focusing on JS and Angular 2+...

âš¡ ... And thanks to my evening courses I increase my skills in web development at the [Institut Saint-Laurent in LiÃ¨ge (in French)](https://www.isl.be/portfolio_item/formation-liege-web-developer-webmaster/ )

#####  Not code related
I currently live in Belgium after studying and working a year and a half in Estonia and several months in Russia

I enjoy telling real stories that happened to people I know
